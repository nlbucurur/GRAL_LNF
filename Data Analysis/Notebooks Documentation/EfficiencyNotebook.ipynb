    "1. **Lambda Expression:** The `hasDetector13` is a lambda expression, which is a convenient way to define an anonymous (unnamed) function right at the location where it is needed. In C++, lambda expressions are a feature that allows you to write inline functions which can capture variables from the surrounding context.\n",
    "2. **Function Signature:** This lambda takes a single parameter:\n",
    "    * `const std::vector<unsigned int>& ids` - A constant reference to a vector of unsigned integers. The const keyword means the vector cannot be modified by the lambda, and `&` indicates that it is passed by reference, which avoids copying the entire vector and thus is more efficient.\n",
    "2. **Function Body::** Inside the lambda, the function uses the std::find algorithm to search through the vector ids:\n",
    "    * `std::find(ids.begin(), ids.end(), 13)` - This call to `std::find` starts looking at the beginning of the vector `(ids.begin())` and continues to the end of the vector `(ids.end())`, searching for the integer `13`.\n",
    "    * The result of `std::find` is compared to `ids.end()`. The `std::find` function returns an iterator to the first element in the range that matches the value (`13` in this case). If no such element is found, `std::find` returns the end iterator `(ids.end())`, which represents a position one past the last element of the vector.\n",
    "4. **Return Value:** The lambda returns a boolean value:\n",
    "    * If `std::find` does not return `ids.end()`, it means the value `13` was found in the vector, so the lambda returns true.\n",
    "    * If `std::find` returns `ids.end()`, it means the value `13` was not found in the vector, so the lambda returns false.\n"

    "    * **`std::unordered_set<int> unique_ids(ids.begin(), ids.end());`:** This line creates a set of integers `(unique_ids)` initialized with the elements from the vector `ids`.
